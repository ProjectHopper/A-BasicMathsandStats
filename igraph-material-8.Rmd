vertex.label.dist	 Distance between the label and the vertex
vertex.label.degree	 The position of the label in relation to the vertex,
 where 0 right, "pi" is left, "pi/2" is below, and "-pi/2" is above
EDGES	 
edge.color	 Edge color

edge.arrow.size	 Arrow size, defaults to 1
edge.arrow.width	 Arrow width, defaults to 1

 3 or "dotted", 4 or "dotdash", 5 or "longdash", 6 or "twodash"
edge.label	 Character vector used to label edges
edge.label.family	 Font family of the label (e.g."Times", "Helvetica")
edge.label.font	 Font: 1 plain, 2 bold, 3, italic, 4 bold italic, 5 symbol
edge.label.cex	 Font size for edge labels
edge.curved	 Edge curvature, range 0-1 (FALSE sets it to 0, TRUE to 0.5)
arrow.mode	 Vector specifying whether edges should have arrows,
 possible values: 0 no arrow, 1 back, 2 forward, 3 both
OTHER	 
margin	 Empty space margins around the plot, vector with length 4
frame	 if TRUE, the plot will be framed
main	 If set, adds a title to the plot
sub	 If set, adds a subtitle to the plot
   

We can set the node & edge options in two ways - the first one is to specify them in the plot() function, as we are doing below.

# Plot with curved edges (edge.curved=.1) and reduce arrow size:

plot(net, edge.arrow.size=.4, edge.curved=.1)


# Set edge color to gray, and the node color to orange. 

# Replace the vertex label with the node names stored in "media"

```{r}
plot(net, edge.arrow.size=.2, edge.curved=0,

     vertex.color="orange", vertex.frame.color="#555555",

     vertex.label=V(net)$media, vertex.label.color="black",

     vertex.label.cex=.7) 
```

##

The second way to set attributes is to add them to the igraph object. Let's say we want to color our network nodes based on type of media, and size them based on audience size (larger audience -> larger node). We will also change the width of the edges based on their weight.

##

```{r}
# Generate colors based on media type:

colrs <- c("gray50", "tomato", "gold")

V(net)$color <- colrs[V(net)$media.type]
```


# Set node size based on audience size:

V(net)$size <- V(net)$audience.size*0.7



# The labels are currently node IDs.

# Setting them to NA will render no labels:

V(net)$label.color <- "black"

V(net)$label <- NA



# Set edge width based on weight:

E(net)$width <- E(net)$weight/6



#change arrow size and edge color:

E(net)$arrow.size <- .2

E(net)$edge.color <- "gray80"



E(net)$width <- 1+E(net)$weight/12


We can also override the attributes explicitly in the plot:

plot(net, edge.color="orange", vertex.color="gray50") 


It helps to add a legend explaining the meaning of the colors we used:

plot(net) 

legend(x=-1.5, y=-1.1, c("Newspaper","Television", "Online News"), pch=21,

       col="#777777", pt.bg=colrs, pt.cex=2, cex=.8, bty="n", ncol=1)


Sometimes, especially with semantic networks, we may be interested in plotting only the labels of the nodes:

plot(net, vertex.shape="none", vertex.label=V(net)$media, 

     vertex.label.font=2, vertex.label.color="gray40",

     vertex.label.cex=.7, edge.color="gray85")


Let's color the edges of the graph based on their source node color. We can get the starting node for each edge with the  ends() igraph function.

edge.start <- ends(net, es=E(net), names=F)[,1]

edge.col <- V(net)$color[edge.start]



plot(net, edge.color=edge.col, edge.curved=.1)  


## 5.2 Network layouts
Network layouts are simply algorithms that return coordinates for each node in a network.

For the purposes of exploring layouts, we will generate a slightly larger 80-node graph. We use the sample_pa() function which generates a simple graph starting from one node and adding more nodes and links based on a preset level of preferential attachment (Barabasi-Albert model).

## 
```{r}
net.bg <- sample_pa(80) 

V(net.bg)$size <- 8

V(net.bg)$frame.color <- "white"

V(net.bg)$color <- "orange"
```

##
```{r}
V(net.bg)$label <- "" 

E(net.bg)$arrow.mode <- 0

plot(net.bg)
```
##

You can set the layout in the plot function:
```{r}
plot(net.bg, layout=layout_randomly)

```
##
Or you can calculate the vertex coordinates in advance:

```{r}
l <- layout_in_circle(net.bg)

plot(net.bg, layout=l)
```

l is simply a matrix of x, y coordinates (N x 2) for the N nodes in the graph. You can easily generate your own:

l <- cbind(1:vcount(net.bg), c(1, vcount(net.bg):2))

plot(net.bg, layout=l)


This layout is just an example and not very helpful - thankfully igraph has a number of built-in layouts, including:

# Randomly placed vertices

l <- layout_randomly(net.bg)

plot(net.bg, layout=l)


# Circle layout

l <- layout_in_circle(net.bg)

plot(net.bg, layout=l)


# 3D sphere layout

l <- layout_on_sphere(net.bg)

plot(net.bg, layout=l)


Fruchterman-Reingold is one of the most used force-directed layout algorithms out there.

Force-directed layouts try to get a nice-looking graph where edges are similar in length and cross each other as little as possible. They simulate the graph as a physical system. Nodes are electrically charged particles that repulse each other when they get too close. The edges act as springs that attract connected nodes closer together. As a result, nodes are evenly distributed through the chart area, and the layout is intuitive in that nodes which share more connections are closer to each other. The disadvantage of these algorithms is that they are rather slow and therefore less often used in graphs larger than ~1000 vertices. You can set the "weight" parameter which increases the attraction forces among nodes connected by heavier edges.

l <- layout_with_fr(net.bg)

plot(net.bg, layout=l)


You will notice that the layout is not deterministic - different runs will result in slightly different configurations. Saving the layout in l allows us to get the exact same result multiple times, which can be helpful if you want to plot the time evolution of a graph, or different relationships - and want nodes to stay in the same place in multiple plots.

par(mfrow=c(2,2), mar=c(0,0,0,0))   # plot four figures - 2 rows, 2 columns

plot(net.bg, layout=layout_with_fr)

plot(net.bg, layout=layout_with_fr)

plot(net.bg, layout=l)

plot(net.bg, layout=l)


dev.off()
By default, the coordinates of the plots are rescaled to the [-1,1] interval for both x and y. You can change that with the parameter rescale=FALSE and rescale your plot manually by multiplying the coordinates by a scalar. You can use norm_coords to normalize the plot with the boundaries you want.

l <- layout_with_fr(net.bg)

l <- norm_coords(l, ymin=-1, ymax=1, xmin=-1, xmax=1)



par(mfrow=c(2,2), mar=c(0,0,0,0))

plot(net.bg, rescale=F, layout=l*0.4)

plot(net.bg, rescale=F, layout=l*0.6)

plot(net.bg, rescale=F, layout=l*0.8)

plot(net.bg, rescale=F, layout=l*1.0)


dev.off()
Another popular force-directed algorithm that produces nice results for connected graphs is Kamada Kawai. Like Fruchterman Reingold, it attempts to minimize the energy in a spring system.

l <- layout_with_kk(net.bg)

plot(net.bg, layout=l)


The LGL algorithm is meant for large, connected graphs. Here you can also specify a root: a node that will be placed in the middle of the layout.

plot(net.bg, layout=layout_with_lgl)


Let's take a look at all available layouts in igraph:

layouts <- grep("^layout_", ls("package:igraph"), value=TRUE)[-1] 

# Remove layouts that do not apply to our graph.

layouts <- layouts[!grepl("bipartite|merge|norm|sugiyama|tree", layouts)]



par(mfrow=c(3,3), mar=c(1,1,1,1))

for (layout in layouts) {

  print(layout)

  l <- do.call(layout, list(net)) 

  plot(net, edge.arrow.mode=0, layout=l, main=layout) }




5.3 Improving network plots


Notice that our network plot is still not too helpful. We can identify the type and size of nodes, but cannot see much about the structure since the links we're examining are so dense. One way to approach this is to see if we can sparsify the network, keeping only the most important ties and discarding the rest.

hist(links$weight)

mean(links$weight)

sd(links$weight)
There are more sophisticated ways to extract the key edges, but for the purposes of this exercise we'll only keep ones that have weight higher than the mean for the network. In igraph, we can delete edges using delete_edges(net, edges):

cut.off <- mean(links$weight) 

net.sp <- delete_edges(net, E(net)[weight<cut.off])

plot(net.sp) 


Another way to think about this is to plot the two tie types (hyperlink & mention) separately.

E(net)$width <- 1.5

plot(net, edge.color=c("dark red", "slategrey")[(E(net)$type=="hyperlink")+1],

      vertex.color="gray40", layout=layout.circle)


net.m <- net - E(net)[E(net)$type=="hyperlink"] # another way to delete edges

net.h <- net - E(net)[E(net)$type=="mention"]



# Plot the two links separately:

par(mfrow=c(1,2))

plot(net.h, vertex.color="orange", main="Tie: Hyperlink")

plot(net.m, vertex.color="lightsteelblue2", main="Tie: Mention")


# Make sure the nodes stay in place in both plots:

l <- layout_with_fr(net)

plot(net.h, vertex.color="orange", layout=l, main="Tie: Hyperlink")

plot(net.m, vertex.color="lightsteelblue2", layout=l, main="Tie: Mention")


dev.off()
5.4 Interactive plotting with tkplot
R and igraph allow for interactive plotting of networks. This might be a useful option for you if you want to tweak slightly the layout of a small graph. After adjusting the layout manually, you can get the coordinates of the nodes and use them for other plots.

tkid <- tkplot(net) #tkid is the id of the tkplot that will open

l <- tkplot.getcoords(tkid) # grab the coordinates from tkplot

tk_close(tkid, window.close = T)

plot(net, layout=l)


5.5 Other ways to represent a network
At this point it might be useful to provide a quick reminder that there are many ways to represent a network not limited to a hairball plot.

For example, here is a quick heatmap of the network matrix:

netm <- get.adjacency(net, attr="weight", sparse=F)

colnames(netm) <- V(net)$media

rownames(netm) <- V(net)$media



palf <- colorRampPalette(c("gold", "dark orange")) 

heatmap(netm[,17:1], Rowv = NA, Colv = NA, col = palf(100), 

        scale="none", margins=c(10,10) )


5.6 Plotting two-mode networks with igraph
As with one-mode networks, we can modify the network object to include the visual properties that will be used by default when plotting the network. Notice that this time we will also change the shape of the nodes - media outlets will be squares, and their users will be circles.

V(net2)$color <- c("steel blue", "orange")[V(net2)$type+1]

V(net2)$shape <- c("square", "circle")[V(net2)$type+1]

V(net2)$label <- ""

V(net2)$label[V(net2)$type==F] <- nodes2$media[V(net2)$type==F] 

V(net2)$label.cex=.4

V(net2)$label.font=2



plot(net2, vertex.label.color="white", vertex.size=(2-V(net2)$type)*8) 


Igraph also has a special layout for bipartite networks (though it doesn't always work great, and you might be better off generating your own two-mode layout).

plot(net2, vertex.label=NA, vertex.size=7, layout=layout_as_bipartite) 


Using text as nodes may be helpful at times:

plot(net2, vertex.shape="none", vertex.label=nodes2$media,

     vertex.label.color=V(net2)$color, vertex.label.font=2.5, 

     vertex.label.cex=.6, edge.color="gray70",  edge.width=2)


6. Network and node descriptives
6.1 Density
The proportion of present edges from all possible edges in the network.

edge_density(net, loops=F)
## [1] 0.1764706
ecount(net)/(vcount(net)*(vcount(net)-1)) #for a directed network
## [1] 0.1764706
6.2 Reciprocity
The proportion of reciprocated ties (for a directed network).

reciprocity(net)

dyad_census(net) # Mutual, asymmetric, and nyll node pairs

2*dyad_census(net)$mut/ecount(net) # Calculating reciprocity
6.3 Transitivity
global - ratio of triangles (direction disregarded) to connected triples.
local - ratio of triangles to connected triples each vertex is part of.
transitivity(net, type="global")  # net is treated as an undirected network

transitivity(as.undirected(net, mode="collapse")) # same as above

transitivity(net, type="local")

triad_census(net) # for directed networks 
Triad types (per Davis & Leinhardt):

003 A, B, C, empty triad.
012 A->B, C
102 A<->B, C
021D A<-B->C
021U A->B<-C
021C A->B->C
111D A<->B<-C
111U A<->B->C
030T A->B<-C, A->C
030C A<-B<-C, A->C.
201 A<->B<->C.
120D A<-B->C, A<->C.
120U A->B<-C, A<->C.
120C A->B->C, A<->C.
210 A->B<->C, A<->C.
300 A<->B<->C, A<->C, completely connected.
6.4 Diameter
A network diameter is the longest geodesic distance (length of the shortest path between two nodes) in the network. In  igraph, diameter() returns the distance, while get_diameter() returns the nodes along the first found path of that distance.

Note that edge weights are used by default, unless set to NA.

diameter(net, directed=F, weights=NA)
## [1] 4
diameter(net, directed=F)
## [1] 28
diam <- get_diameter(net, directed=T)

diam
## + 7/17 vertices, named:

## [1] s12 s06 s17 s04 s03 s08 s07
Note that get_diameter() returns a vertex sequence. Note though that when asked to behaved as a vector, a vertex sequence will produce the numeric indexes of the nodes in it. The same applies for edge sequences.

class(diam)
## [1] "igraph.vs"
as.vector(diam)
## [1] 12  6 17  4  3  8  7
Color nodes along the diameter:

vcol <- rep("gray40", vcount(net))

vcol[diam] <- "gold"

ecol <- rep("gray80", ecount(net))

ecol[E(net, path=diam)] <- "orange" 

# E(net, path=diam) finds edges along a path, here 'diam'

plot(net, vertex.color=vcol, edge.color=ecol, edge.arrow.mode=0)


6.5 Node degrees
The function degree() has a mode of in for in-degree, out for out-degree, and all or total for total degree.

deg <- degree(net, mode="all")

plot(net, vertex.size=deg*3)


hist(deg, breaks=1:vcount(net)-1, main="Histogram of node degree")


6.6 Degree distribution
deg.dist <- degree_distribution(net, cumulative=T, mode="all")

plot( x=0:max(deg), y=1-deg.dist, pch=19, cex=1.2, col="orange", 

      xlab="Degree", ylab="Cumulative Frequency")


6.7 Centrality & centralization
Centrality functions (vertex level) and centralization functions (graph level). The centralization functions return res - vertex centrality, centralization, and theoretical_max - maximum centralization score for a graph of that size. The centrality function can run on a subset of nodes (set with the vids parameter). This is helpful for large graphs where calculating all centralities may be a resource-intensive and time-consuming task.

Degree (number of ties)

degree(net, mode="in")

centr_degree(net, mode="in", normalized=T)
Closeness (centrality based on distance to others in the graph)
Inverse of the node's average geodesic distance to others in the network.

closeness(net, mode="all", weights=NA) 

centr_clo(net, mode="all", normalized=T) 
Eigenvector (centrality proportional to the sum of connection centralities)
Values of the first eigenvector of the graph matrix.

eigen_centrality(net, directed=T, weights=NA)

centr_eigen(net, directed=T, normalized=T) 
Betweenness (centrality based on a broker position connecting others)
Number of geodesics that pass through the node or the edge.

betweenness(net, directed=T, weights=NA)

edge_betweenness(net, directed=T, weights=NA)

centr_betw(net, directed=T, normalized=T)
6.8 Hubs and authorities
The hubs and authorities algorithm developed by Jon Kleinberg was initially used to examine web pages. Hubs were expected to contain catalogs with a large number of outgoing links; while authorities would get many incoming links from hubs, presumably because of their high-quality relevant information.

hs <- hub_score(net, weights=NA)$vector

as <- authority_score(net, weights=NA)$vector



par(mfrow=c(1,2))

 plot(net, vertex.size=hs*50, main="Hubs")

 plot(net, vertex.size=as*30, main="Authorities")


dev.off()
7. Distances and paths
Average path length: the mean of the shortest distance between each pair of nodes in the network (in both directions for directed graphs).

mean_distance(net, directed=F)
## [1] 2.058824
mean_distance(net, directed=T)
## [1] 2.742188
We can also find the length of all shortest paths in the graph:

distances(net) # with edge weights

distances(net, weights=NA) # ignore weights
We can extract the distances to a node or set of nodes we are interested in. Here we will get the distance of every media from the New York Times.

dist.from.NYT <- distances(net, v=V(net)[media=="NY Times"], to=V(net), weights=NA)



# Set colors to plot the distances:

oranges <- colorRampPalette(c("dark red", "gold"))

col <- oranges(max(dist.from.NYT)+1)

col <- col[dist.from.NYT+1]



plot(net, vertex.color=col, vertex.label=dist.from.NYT, edge.arrow.size=.6, 

     vertex.label.color="white")


We can also find the shortest path between specific nodes. Say here between MSNBC and the New York Post:

news.path <- shortest_paths(net, 

                            from = V(net)[media=="MSNBC"], 

                             to  = V(net)[media=="New York Post"],

                             output = "both") # both path nodes and edges



# Generate edge color variable to plot the path:

ecol <- rep("gray80", ecount(net))

ecol[unlist(news.path$epath)] <- "orange"

# Generate edge width variable to plot the path:

ew <- rep(2, ecount(net))

ew[unlist(news.path$epath)] <- 4

# Generate node color variable to plot the path:

vcol <- rep("gray40", vcount(net))

vcol[unlist(news.path$vpath)] <- "gold"



plot(net, vertex.color=vcol, edge.color=ecol, 

     edge.width=ew, edge.arrow.mode=0)


Identify the edges going into or out of a vertex, for instance the WSJ. For a single node, use incident(), for multiple nodes use incident_edges()

inc.edges <- incident(net,  V(net)[media=="Wall Street Journal"], mode="all")



# Set colors to plot the selected edges.

ecol <- rep("gray80", ecount(net))

ecol[inc.edges] <- "orange"

vcol <- rep("grey40", vcount(net))

vcol[V(net)$media=="Wall Street Journal"] <- "gold"

plot(net, vertex.color=vcol, edge.color=ecol)


We can also easily identify the immediate neighbors of a vertex, say WSJ. The neighbors function finds all nodes one step out from the focal actor.To find the neighbors for multiple nodes, use adjacent_vertices() instead of neighbors(). To find node neighborhoods going more than one step out, use function ego() with parameter order set to the number of steps out to go from the focal node(s).

neigh.nodes <- neighbors(net, V(net)[media=="Wall Street Journal"], mode="out")



# Set colors to plot the neighbors:

vcol[neigh.nodes] <- "#ff9d00"

plot(net, vertex.color=vcol)


Special operators for the indexing of edge sequences: %-%, %->%, %<-%
* E(network)[X %-% Y] selects edges between vertex sets X and Y, ignoring direction
* E(network)[X %->% Y] selects edges from vertex sets X to vertex set Y
* E(network)[X %->% Y] selects edges from vertex sets Y to vertex set X

For example, select edges from newspapers to online sources:

E(net)[ V(net)[type.label=="Newspaper"] %->% V(net)[type.label=="Online"] ]
## + 7/48 edges (vertex names):

## [1] s01->s15 s03->s12 s04->s12 s04->s17 s05->s15 s06->s16 s06->s17
Co-citation (for a couple of nodes, how many shared nominations they have):

8. Subgroups and communities
Before we start, we will make our network undirected. There are several ways to do that conversion:

We can create an undirected link between any pair of connected nodes (mode="collapse")
Create undirected link for each directed one in the network, potentially ending up with a multiplex graph (mode="each")
Create undirected link for each symmetric link in the graph (mode="mutual").
In cases when we may have ties A -> B and B -> A ties collapsed into a single undirected link, we need to specify what to do with their edge attributes using the parameter 'edge.attr.comb' as we did earlier with simplify(). Here we have said that the 'weight' of the links should be summed, and all other edge attributes ignored and dropped.

net.sym <- as.undirected(net, mode= "collapse",

                         edge.attr.comb=list(weight="sum", "ignore"))
8.1 Cliques
Find cliques (complete subgraphs of an undirected graph)

cliques(net.sym) # list of cliques       

sapply(cliques(net.sym), length) # clique sizes

largest_cliques(net.sym) # cliques with max number of nodes
vcol <- rep("grey80", vcount(net.sym))

vcol[unlist(largest_cliques(net.sym))] <- "gold"

plot(as.undirected(net.sym), vertex.label=V(net.sym)$name, vertex.color=vcol)


8.2 Community detection
A number of algorithms aim to detect groups that consist of densely connected nodes with fewer connections across groups.

Community detection based on edge betweenness (Newman-Girvan)
High-betweenness edges are removed sequentially (recalculating at each step) and the best partitioning of the network is selected.

ceb <- cluster_edge_betweenness(net) 

dendPlot(ceb, mode="hclust")


plot(ceb, net) 


Let's examine the community detection igraph object:

class(ceb)
## [1] "communities"
length(ceb)     # number of communities
## [1] 5
membership(ceb) # community membership for each node
## s01 s02 s03 s04 s05 s06 s07 s08 s09 s10 s11 s12 s13 s14 s15 s16 s17 

##   1   2   3   4   1   4   3   3   5   5   4   4   4   4   1   4   4
modularity(ceb) # how modular the graph partitioning is
## [1] 0.292476
crossing(ceb, net)   # boolean vector: TRUE for edges across communities
High modularity for a partitioning reflects dense connections within communities and sparse connections across communities.

Community detection based on based on propagating labels
Assigns node labels, randomizes, than replaces each vertex's label with the label that appears most frequently among neighbors. Those steps are repeated until each vertex has the most common label of its neighbors.

clp <- cluster_label_prop(net)

plot(clp, net)


Community detection based on greedy optimization of modularity

cfg <- cluster_fast_greedy(as.undirected(net))

plot(cfg, as.undirected(net))


We can also plot the communities without relying on their built-in plot:

V(net)$community <- cfg$membership

colrs <- adjustcolor( c("gray50", "tomato", "gold", "yellowgreen"), alpha=.6)

plot(net, vertex.color=colrs[V(net)$community])


### K-core decomposition
The k-core is the maximal subgraph in which every node has degree of at least k. The result here gives the coreness of each vertex in the network. A node has coreness D if it belongs to a D-core but not to (D+1)-core.

kc <- coreness(net, mode="all")

plot(net, vertex.size=kc*6, vertex.label=kc, vertex.color=colrs[kc])


### Assortativity and Homophily
Homophily: the tendency of nodes to connect to others who are similar on some variable.

assortativity_nominal() is for categorical variables (labels)
assortativity() is for ordinal and above variables
assortativity_degree() checks assortativity in node degrees
assortativity_nominal(net, V(net)$media.type, directed=F)
## [1] 0.1715568
assortativity(net, V(net)$audience.size, directed=F)
## [1] -0.1102857
assortativity_degree(net, directed=F)
## [1] -0.009551146
